## Brief Description of the data
This data is _Use of Force_, from _Seattle Open Data_. It shows different incidents in which
law enforcement has used force on people, and it includes data such as the level of force, and the race & 
gender of the person the force was used on. 

## Explanation of widgets
On the tab with the *bar plot*, the first widget allows you to choose which gender to display on the plot.
You can pick any combination of male, female, or non-binary. The second widget on that tab allows you to 
pick the color of the bar. 

On the tab with the *table*, the widget allows you to filter the data by picking the level of force.
